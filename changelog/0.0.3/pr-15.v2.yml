  description: '`gradle-revapi` now detects the presence of the `gradle-git-version`
    plugin and will use the last tag returned by that as a default for the `oldVersion`.
    Now will only create the `revapi` task when applied on projects that have the
    `maven-publish` plugin as well as the `java` plugin.'
