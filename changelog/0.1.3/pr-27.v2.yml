improvement:
  description: If the previous API jars that gradle-revapi is trying to compare against
    do not exist, analysis will be skipped as there is no way to compare against the
    previous version of the API. This behaviour is configurable with the `failIfOldApiCannotBeResolved`
    toggle.
